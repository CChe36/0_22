Expecting to see some oscillations as with the mach number plot, however the exponential rise in pressure calls into quesiton the usage of boundary conditions in this case.

The plot of pressure over time along the bottom of the wall of the inlet at x = 0.09m, y = 0.011m. A small pink node at that location highlights where the cell is.

Plot of the Mach number at that same location over time.
